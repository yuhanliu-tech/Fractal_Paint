## 🌅 Ocean Surface: Tiling & Blending

Implementation of 2024 High Performance Graphics paper [Fast Orientable Aperiodic Ocean Synthesis Using Tiling & Blending](http://arnaud-schoentgen.com/publication/2024_orientable_ocean/2024_orientable_ocean.pdf)

We implemented the above paper's technique for creating a fast and believable ocean surface by combining tiling and blending methods with a foundational sinusoidal ocean texture.

We begin with a simple, periodic sinusoidal texture, called our "exemplar texture", created by overlapping sine waves to create a simple ocean (left image). The core idea is to efficiently synthesize a realistic ocean by overlapping multiple texture tiles, specifically utilizing three regular hexagonal tilings (middle image). In this method, each texel (texture pixel) is influenced by multiple tiles, with blending weights peaking at the center of each tile and diminishing towards the edges. This approach preserves the spatial mean and variance of the exemplar texture, resulting in a seamless and non-repetitive ocean surface (right image).

This technique is implemented in a WebGPU compute shader, resulting in an ocean texture that preserves the physical characteristics of waves while concealing artificial-looking periodicity. Below is a GIF showing our results.

### Fractalized Mesh Generation

Implementation of 2024 SIGGRAPH paper [Into the portal: Directable Fractal Self-Similarity](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3641519.3657466) by Alexa Schor and Theodore Kim

<img src="img/fractal_flow.png" width="500"/> 

We utilize Schor and Kim's technique for fractalizing meshes, which involves using Julia-set-inspired dynamical system to generate specifiable self-similar regions with chaotic details. The workflow, described in the image above, includes taking an arbitrary input OBJ which is then converted into an SDF and used to introduce self-similarity and fractal effects. 

We use this technique for generating fractalized coral assets, and examples of resulting meshes are pictured below.

### Raymarched Jellyfish

(FIXME: Jellyfish img)

We created a fragment shader that utilizes ray marching to render jellyfish NPCs. The shader uses ray marching to traverse the underwater space, calculating distances to shapes defined by signed distance functions. Procedural noise functions drive animated effects like pulsation, creating a sense of movement. Volumetric techniques simulate translucent effects, creating the appearance of light scattering within the jellyfish, while custom lighting calculations enhance realism with reflections, refractions, and ambient light. The shader efficiently renders multiple jellyfish instances through spatial repetition functions and optimizes performance by skipping empty spaces during ray marching.
